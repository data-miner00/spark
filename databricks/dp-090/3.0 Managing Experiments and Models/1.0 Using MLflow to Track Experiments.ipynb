        "In this exercise, you will use the `nyc-taxi` dataset that you created for lab 2 to train a model which predicts the total fare based on a subset of the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission - green taxi trip records.  You will create a linear regression model as in the prior lab. In this notebook, a key difference is that you will train variants of this model, changing **hyperparameters** to try to achieve better performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "You will also use MLflow to log the associated metrics, parameters, artifacts, and model for each attempt.  The goal of this process is to determine which hyperparameters work best for generating accurate predictions.  Keeping track of results on your own in a spreadsheet or text document is possible but inefficient.  It would be better to do this work as close to the model and training process as possible.  With MLflow, you can create **experiments** to do just that.  An experiment is a logical collection of **runs**.  Each run is a different attempt at training.  You can control the nature of these runs--in this experiment, you will try out a series of hyperparameters for the same algorithm and data and compare which fares best.  But that's not the only way you can use experiments.  For example, you could create an experiment and have each run of the experiment try out a different algorithm altogether, or create an experiment and have each run look at a different subset of data for training."
